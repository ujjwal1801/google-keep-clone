# GoogleKeepClone

This project is an attempt to recreate a notes taking app like Google Keep. The app currently supports adding, pinning, archiving and crud operations on the notes.

# Tech-stack used
The application has been developed in Angular 9 and uses Redux for state management. The application also switches between light and dark mode. No third party CSS framework has been used. I have been learning React/Redux so thought this would be a perfect opportunity to at least get the gist of how Redux works. Since the application required a deadline, I chose to develop it in Angular as I am proficient in it. It is my first time with Redux so any comments on better usage would be much appreciated. 

# Project setup

1. Install Angular by running this command in the terminal - `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. Install dependencies by running `npm i`
3. Serve the code to localhost with the command `ng serve`
4. Open `localhost:4200` to access the application.

# Planned enhancements
1. Adding Markdown and image support
2. Implementing Masonry without any framework. The code is already written in the application, just needs a little tweaking.
3. Adding custom label support
